Build the Second Brain Application
Application Name
Second Brain
Purpose
The Second Brain is a client-side only web application designed to assist students in managing their study schedules and tracking their progress. All functionality runs entirely in the browser with no backend, and the app works offline after the initial load. It is optimized for mobile use, prioritizing a seamless experience on phone screens. The app features a visually stunning, animated user interface with a dark mode theme and red accents, ensuring it is intuitive, touch-friendly, and production-ready. All data is stored locally using Dexie.js, ensuring zero server dependencies.

Functionality:  
Users can add, edit, or delete subjects and topics.  
Users can set study goals or deadlines for each topic.


UI and Animations:  
Display subjects in expandable cards with a dark background (e.g., #1E1E1E) and red accents (e.g., #FF5252) for buttons and highlights.  
Each card shows the subject name, exam date, and progress (e.g., "3/5 topics completed"), with an animated progress bar that fills smoothly.  
Tapping a card triggers a smooth expansion animation (e.g., scale and fade) to reveal the list of topics.  
Topics include checkboxes with animations (e.g., red color change when checked) and fields to set/edit deadlines.



2. Study Schedule

Functionality:  
Users can plan study sessions in advance by specifying the date, time, and duration.  
A visual timetable displays all planned study sessions, color-coded by subject with red shades for accents.  
Client-side reminders (e.g., notification banners) for upcoming sessions.


UI and Animations:  
Use animated transitions for adding or rescheduling sessions (e.g., fade-in, slide on drag).  
Reminders slide in from the top with a red highlight.



3. Progress Tracking

Functionality:  
Track progress for each subject based on completed topics or study sessions.  
Display progress with animated charts (e.g., line charts for progress over time, bar charts for subject comparison).  
Provide alerts if the user is falling behind schedule (e.g., "You need to complete 2 topics per week to meet the deadline").  
Optional gamification: points, streaks, or badges for meeting goals.


UI and Animations:  
Charts use red for progress indicators, with smooth animations (e.g., lines drawing, bars filling).  
Gamification elements (if included) have pop-up animations for achievements.



4. Timetable

Functionality:  
A visual timetable displays all planned study sessions, color-coded by subject.  
Allow users to drag and drop sessions to reschedule them.  
Detect and highlight scheduling conflicts or overlaps with red warnings.


UI and Animations:  
Sessions are color-coded by subject, with red for active or selected sessions.  
Smooth drag-and-drop animations; conflicts are highlighted with red warnings.



Technical Requirements

No Backend, Ever:All functionality must be client-side, using Dexie.js for local storage. The app must work offline after the initial load.  
Tech Stack:  
TypeScript + React: For building a robust, interactive UI.  
Framer Motion: For smooth, mobile-optimized animations.  
Tailwind CSS: For a responsive, mobile-first design with dark mode styling.  
React Big Calendar: For the timetable component.  
Recharts: For animated progress charts.


Data Models:  
Subject:  
id: string  
name: string (e.g., "Machine Learning (CS-601)")  
examDate: Date (e.g., new Date("2025-06-05"))  
topics: Array of Topic objects


Topic:  
id: string  
name: string (e.g., "UNIT-1: Introduction to machine learning")  
completed: boolean (default: false)  
goalDate: Date (optional)


StudySession:  
id: string  
subjectId: string  
topicId: string (optional)  
startTime: Date  
endTime: Date  
completed: boolean (default: false)




Initial Data:On first load, seed the database with the provided subjects, exam dates, and topics (no mock data).  
Mobile-Responsive UI:Prioritize phone screens with touch-friendly elements and a bottom navigation bar. Use swipe gestures (e.g., swipe to mark sessions as done).

UI and UX Requirements

Dark Mode Theme with Red Accents:  
Background: Dark gray/black (e.g., #121212)  
Text: Light gray/white (e.g., #E0E0E0)  
Accents: Red (e.g., #FF5252) for buttons, highlights, progress bars, and alerts.


Unique, Non-Generic Design:Avoid standard web app aesthetics; aim for a futuristic or brain-inspired theme (e.g., subtle neural network patterns in the background). Use custom icons or illustrations related to studying or brain concepts.  
Animations:Use Framer Motion for smooth, lightweight animations:  
Spring animations for card expansions and movements.  
Ease-in-out transitions for progress bars and charts.  
Subtle tap effects on buttons (e.g., scale, red glow).


Mobile Optimization:Touch-friendly elements with large tap targets. Swipe gestures for actions like marking topics or sessions as complete. Timetable defaults to day view on mobile for better usability.  
Third-Party Component Styling:Customize React Big Calendar and Recharts to match the dark theme (dark backgrounds, light text, red accents).

Constraints

No Backend Allowed: All logic and storage must be handled client-side via Dexie.js.  
Real Data Only: The app must use the provided subjects, exam dates, and syllabus topics—no mock or placeholder data.  
Mobile-First Design: Fully responsive, with a focus on phone usability.  
Dark Mode Only: No light mode; ensure all elements are visible and legible on dark backgrounds.

Deliverables

Full Source Code:Include all React components, styles, and Dexie.js setup. Use inline comments to explain key logic (e.g., data seeding, progress calculations).  
Custom Assets:Provide custom icons or illustrations to support the unique design.  
Production-Ready:The app must be optimized for performance and ready to deploy as a static web app (e.g., hostable on GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.). Tested on mobile devices to ensure compatibility and smooth performance.  
Detailed README:Provide a comprehensive README alongside the project, included as part of the deliverable.

Additional Notes

Ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use, especially on mobile devices.  
Pay attention to performance, as the app should run smoothly even with animations.  
Make sure all features are fully functional and tested.
